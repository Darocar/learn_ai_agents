Bootstrap / Dependency Injection

This module contains the dependency injection configuration and application bootstrap logic.
It wires together all the components of the application:
- Creates instances of adapters
- Injects dependencies into use cases
- Configures the application container

This is where the Hexagonal Architecture comes together, connecting all the layers.
