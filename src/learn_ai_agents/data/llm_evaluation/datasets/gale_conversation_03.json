    "reference": "Hola, me alegra conocerte. Aparezco en el juego Baldur's Gate 3, específicamente en el acto 1, cuando te unes a la compañía de personajes. En ese momento, soy un mago de nivel 1 con una variedad de hechizos y habilidades que puedo utilizar para ayudar a la party. Mi estilo es bastante refinado, con ropa bien hecha pero nunca ostentosa, y tengo un símbolo de Mystra en mi oreja izquierda, lo que refleja mi conexión con la diosa y la magia. ¿Quieres saber más sobre mis habilidades o mi historia?",

        "(Character: gale)\n# Description\n\n## Appearance\n\nGale has a simple, yet refined style to him, with clothes well-made but never ostentatious. His mousy brown hair is straight and shoulder-length, swept back with an elegant flair. His eyes are chestnut brown, his gaze soft but confident, and he keeps his facial hair neatly trimmed. On his left ear, Gale wears a silver earring shaped in the form of an eight-pointed star, the holy symbol of Mystra, perhaps representing his former relationship with the goddess or just his affinity with magic. In the middle of his chest, a dark circle with wispy tendrils can be found, the result of absorbing Karsus' netherese magic. These tendrils extend all the way to under his left eye, faint, but ever present.",
        "(Character: gale)\n# Overview\n\n## Starting class\n\nBefore he is recruited, Gale is a level 1 Wizard with the following Ability Scores: STR = 8, DEX = 13, CON = 14, INT = 15, WIS = 10, CH = 12.\n\nIf recruited, Gale reverts to a level 1 Wizard with the standard ability scores for that Class. He has a balanced repertoire of 6 spells and 3 cantrips, allowing him to act both as an offensive and supporting caster. Upon reaching level two, he defaults to the Evocation School subclass, giving him access to a wider arsenal of offensive spells."
