# LEARN-AI-AGENTS — Branch `00_folder_structure`

This branch sets up a **teaching repository** for building LLM‑powered agents using **Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)**. There’s deliberately **no business logic yet**—just a clean, future‑proof layout, wiring spots, and configuration stubs so the next branches can add features without fighting the structure.

> Stack: **Python 3.12** + **uv** for environments, dependencies, and scripts; **FastAPI** will be the first inbound adapter.

---

## Why this layout?

We follow **Hexagonal Architecture** so the *application core* is technology‑agnostic. The core talks to the outside world through **ports** (interfaces); framework‑ or vendor‑specific **adapters** plug into those ports at the edges. This makes it easy to swap UI, LLM providers, databases, tracers, etc., without touching the core logic.

### Layer responsibilities (at a glance)

- **application/** — Use‑case layer (a.k.a. “application services”). Contains:
  - **inbound_ports/**: *input boundaries* (interfaces) that controllers call.
  - **use_cases/**: classes that **implement inbound ports** and orchestrate domain + outbound ports.
  - **outbound_ports/**: the app’s needs (LLM, vector index, repositories, observability, tools) expressed as interfaces.
  - **dtos/**: input/output data shapes used by use cases (keeps HTTP models out of the core).
- **domain/** — Pure business concepts: entities/value objects (`models/`) and policies (`services/`). Absolutely no vendor or framework imports.
- **infrastructure/** — Adapters on the edge:
  - **inbound/**: FastAPI routers/controllers (they validate, map DTOs, then **call inbound ports**).
  - **outbound/**: concrete tech adapters that **implement outbound ports** (LLM providers, DBs, tracers, tools).
- **bootstrap/** — The **Composition Root**. Instantiate adapters and inject them into use cases (constructor injection). Only this layer knows which vendor you chose. The rest of the app stays agnostic.

---

## How a request flows (end‑to‑end)

1. **FastAPI router** (`infrastructure/inbound/`) receives HTTP, validates input models, and maps them to **application DTOs**.  
2. Router **calls an inbound port** (`application/inbound_ports/`).  
3. The **use case** (`application/use_cases/`) implements that port: loads domain state, applies policies, and calls **outbound ports** for I/O.  
4. **Outbound adapters** (`infrastructure/outbound/`) talk to real tech (LLM, DB, tracer, tools) and return domain‑friendly results.  
5. The use case returns a result DTO; the router maps it to an HTTP response model.

This keeps controllers thin and the core independent of frameworks/providers.

---

## Python 3.12 + uv quickstart

> Requires: [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed and available on your PATH.

```bash
# 1) Ensure Python 3.12 is installed via uv
uv python install 3.12

# 2) Create & sync the project environment from pyproject.toml
uv sync

# 3) Run tests (empty at this stage, but wired)
uv run pytest -q

# 4) (Later) run the API once the first route exists
uv run uvicorn learn_ai_agents.<your_api_module>:app --reload
```

**Notes**
- `pyproject.toml` follows **PEP 621** so tools (including uv) can read project metadata & dependencies.
- `uv sync` creates an isolated `.venv/` and keeps it in sync with the `pyproject.toml`.
- `Makefile` provides convenient shortcuts once targets are added.

---

## Configuration & environment

- Copy **`.env.example`** to **`.env`** and fill values for local dev (API keys, DB URLs, etc.).  
- Add a config loader (e.g., Pydantic `BaseSettings`) in `bootstrap/` to read `env` and/or `YAML` and construct adapters accordingly.

---

## Testing strategy (once code lands)

- **unit/**: domain models & use cases (replace outbound ports with fakes).  
- **integration/**: each adapter against a real sandbox (e.g., OpenAI test, local Qdrant).  
- **e2e/**: FastAPI routes calling real use cases with a test container stack.

---

## Conventions

- **Ports are framework‑free** (`Protocol`/ABC in `application/…_ports/`).  
- **Controllers call inbound ports.** Outbound adapters implement outbound ports.  
- **No service locator**: all wiring happens once in `bootstrap/` (constructor injection).  
- **Domain stays pure**: avoid importing infra/application from domain.

---

Happy building! Subsequent branches will add the first use case, a small FastAPI router, and a couple of outbound adapters (LLM + persistence) to demonstrate the full ports‑and‑adapters flow.
